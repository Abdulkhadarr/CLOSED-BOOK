## 🔍 Overview

**CLOSED BOOK** is a secure, web-based vault designed to safely **store passwords and private files** such as images, documents, audio, and videos — all protected by a single **Master Password** and **OTP verification**.

It provides a strong defense against unauthorized access, brute-force, and key-logger attacks using **multi-layer encryption (AES, RSA, and Hashing)**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- To develop a **secure, web-based vault** for storing credentials and personal files.  
- To implement **multi-level encryption** using Hashing, AES, and RSA algorithms.  
- To ensure **data privacy** and protection against unauthorized access or leaks.  
- To provide **OTP-based authentication** for enhanced security.  
- To protect users from **key-logger and brute-force attacks**.
